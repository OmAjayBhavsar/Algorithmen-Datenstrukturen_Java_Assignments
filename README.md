# Algorithms and Data Structures ‚Äì Java Assignments

This repository contains selected programming assignments from the ‚ÄúAlgorithms and Data Structures‚Äù module, completed as part of the B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg.  
The focus is on implementing classic data structures such as trees, lists, heaps, and hashing, as well as symbolic math and algorithmic problem solving.
